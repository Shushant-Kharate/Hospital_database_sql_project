## Overview
This project is a structured SQL practice set based on a hospital management scenario. It involves querying a healthcare database that includes patients, doctors, admissions, and province information. The queries cover a wide range of SQL concepts such as filtering, joining tables, aggregation, grouping, and conditional logic.

## Objective

- To simulate a hospital database environment for practicing SQL queries with realistic healthcare data.
- To assist in understanding how doctors and hospital administrators can retrieve meaningful insights from data.
- To explore core SQL concepts including `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `CASE`.
- To simulate practical data retrieval tasks from a hospital database system.
- To understand how to query and analyze relational data using SQL.
- To demonstrate how structured queries can be used for patient management, diagnosis tracking, and resource analysis.
- To create a ready-to-use SQL portfolio project for interviews or coursework showcasing hands-on database skills.
